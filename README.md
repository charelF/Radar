todo:
-  callout from annotatio: see if we can insert a custom view or similar, so that we can fit our whole activity presentation inside such a callout.
- include ask for location and center app on users location
- see if its possible to resize the markers

- explore which swift file is the best to store the activity arrays? Right now we can store them in activity.swift in a static function, but how to do it latter on? One class that handles requests maybe and stores an activity array that can be accessed by the different view controllers?
