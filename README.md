#  Radar

iOS app that shows activities nearby. Users can create, explore and join activities. The app is meant to connect users that share similar interests in real life.

The app was developed during one semester to get more experienced with Swift and iOS Development.

There is also a backend [Radar-Server](https://github.com/charelF/Radar-Server) and a SwiftUI version [Radar-SwiftUI](https://github.com/charelF/Radar-SwiftUI)

All 3 projects are prototypes and not fully working applications.
